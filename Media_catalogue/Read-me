# Media Catalogue Lab

This Python lab is a practical exercise on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. The goal was to create a media catalogue that can store **movies** and **TV series** while practicing class design, inheritance, and error handling.

## What I Learned

* **Classes and Objects**: How to define classes and create objects.  
* **Inheritance**: How a child class (`TVSeries`) can inherit properties and methods from a parent class (`Movie`).  
* **Docstrings**: How to document classes and methods using docstrings.  
* **Custom Exceptions**: How to define and use custom exceptions (`MediaError`) to handle invalid operations.  
* **Type Checking**: Using `type()` and `isinstance()` to differentiate between parent and child classes.  
* **Magic Methods**: Implementing `__str__` for readable string representations of objects.  
* **Collections**: Managing multiple objects in a catalogue (list) and filtering them based on type.  
* **Error Handling**: Using `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle validation errors.

## Features

* Add **movies** and **TV series** to a catalogue.  
* Display a **formatted list** of movies and TV series separately.  
* Validate inputs such as title, year, duration, seasons, and total episodes.  
* Handle invalid additions with **custom exceptions**.
