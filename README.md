## Employee Salary Tracker

**Employee Salary Tracker** is a Python project from FreeCodeCamp that helped me explore **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in a practical way.

Through this lab, I learned how to:

* Create **classes and objects** to model real-world entities.
* Use **private attributes** and control access with **getters and setters**.
* Enforce **business rules** like promotions, preventing demotions, and ensuring salaries never fall below minimum levels.
* Apply **data validation** and **custom error handling** to make programs safe and predictable.

This project taught me how Python can **simulate real-life workflows**, making code both functional and maintainable. It was a great way to practice **thinking like a developer**, designing systems where every change is controlled and meaningful feedback is given.


# Lessons Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

  >> Implement real-world business rules using Python OOP.

  >> Safely manage sensitive attributes like salary using getters/setters.

  >> Use custom error messages to guide users and prevent invalid operations.

  >> Understand how object attributes interact and how promotions affect employee data.
